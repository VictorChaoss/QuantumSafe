const faq: [string, React.ReactNode][] = [
  [
    "Is Quantum Safe a wallet?",
    <>
      No. You keep the everyday hot wallet you already use to trade and interact with dApps. Quantum Safe
      is a separate post-quantum vault on Solana where you sweep your capital. Your hot wallet pays network
      fees; its Ed25519 signature cannot authorize a withdrawal from your Quantum Safe.
    </>,
  ],
  [
    "Why SHA-256 hash chains instead of standard wallet keys?",
    <>
      Standard Solana and Ethereum wallets rely on elliptic-curve signatures (Ed25519 / ECDSA), which
      expose a static public key and are vulnerable both to phishing drainers today and Shor’s quantum
      algorithm tomorrow. Quantum Safe uses RFC 8554 Leighton-Micali One-Time Signatures (LM-OTS) built
      purely from 34 parallel SHA-256 hash chains.
    </>,
  ],
  [
    "I already use a hardware wallet. Why would I need this?",
    <>
      A hardware wallet keeps your private key off your computer, but it still signs whatever transaction
      you approve—including a disguised drainer payload. Quantum Safe separates deposits from withdrawals
      using one-time SHA-256 hash chains, and your hardware wallet acts as the ideal instant-payout
      trusted destination.
    </>,
  ],
  [
    "What if someone steals my Day Key?",
    <>
      When you initialize a Quantum Safe you list up to four trusted addresses and a waiting period (24 hours
      by default) for everything else. A thief with your Day Key can only send instantly to your own
      trusted addresses. Any withdrawal to an unknown address enters the 24-hour public countdown—giving
      you time to upload your Stop File and cancel it immediately.
    </>,
  ],
  [
    "What happens if I lose my recovery kit or its password?",
    <>
      Your Day Key keeps working, so nothing is lost that day. However, the offline Recovery Kit is the
      only thing that can rotate a lost or stolen Day Key. Nobody can reset it for you—store the recovery
      kit offline.
    </>,
  ],
  [
    "What if this website goes away?",
    <>
      Your vault lives on the Solana blockchain with renounced upgrade authority and zero admin keys.
      Both the offline recovery tool and the single-file Node.js CLI (<code>qsafe-cli.mjs</code>) run
      locally against any Solana RPC without needing this website.
